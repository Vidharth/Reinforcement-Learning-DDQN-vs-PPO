# Reinforcement-Learning-RUG-DL-Course

The project was part of the final project for the Deep Learning Course in the University of Groningen

The main contributors of this project are: Hari Vidharth, Krishnakumar Santhakumar, Ashwin Vaidya, Dhawal Salvi

This project was done to compare the performance of RL algorithms namely DDQN and PPO in open AI gym and Unity environments.

Need to download and load the Unity env plugins separately.

## Requirments :

Python - version 3.7

### Libraries required :

- Tensorflow(gpu) - version 2.0.0
- keras - version 2.3.1
- unity ml-agents - version 0.16.0
- openAi gym - version 0.17.1
- numpy - version 1.18.3

## Environment Builds

Please read the included research paper for the experiments conducted and the results obtained.
